The LORD is so good to me. My love for Him is unconditional. He always watches over me 
and my family. We owe everything to Him.

Lord God, You are my God. I get strength from you, you provide me hope and you give me 
the will to push on through. With You by my side, I WILL always prevail.

Jesus Master the Way the Truth and the Life. Have mercy on us.
Queen of the apostles. Pray for us.
St. Paul the apostle. Pray for us.
From all sin, deliver us oh Lord.
